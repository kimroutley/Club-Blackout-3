## Notes

- Some mechanics (like Lightweight's taboo names) are primarily social/manual and may not need full digital implementation
- Clinger mechanics require careful UI/UX design to avoid revealing the role
- Wallflower's "optional" observation is a player choice, not automated
- Many day-phase abilities need voting system updates
